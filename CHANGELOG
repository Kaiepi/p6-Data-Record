Revision history for Data::Record

v0.0.1:
    - Initial release.

v0.0.2:
    - Use .pm6 as the modules' file extension, not .rakumod, to preserve
      compatibility with older compiler releases.

v0.0.3:
    - Return self from array ops in Data::Record::List.

v0.0.4:
    - Remove redundant gist method candidates from Data::Record::Map and
      Data::Record::Tuple, which prevented the method from being called.

v0.0.5:
    - Fix handling of containers with some array op and private helper methods.

v0.0.6:
    - Implement push and append methods for Data::Record::Map and remove its
      pop, shift, unshift, and prepend methods in order for it to match Hash's
      API.

v0.1.0:
    - Implement structural typings for maps with Data::Record::Map.
